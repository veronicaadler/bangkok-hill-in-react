# Bangkok Hill 

Created as an honors project for Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, this project is the React version of the new Bangkok Hill website.  Designed for a local Thai restaurant, it demonstrates use of responsive, mobile-first design principles.   


## Motivation

This project was designed and developed to provide Bangkok Hill with a new, mobile friendly website that could serve as the foundation of a strong online presence.

## Features

A newly added online ordering feature allows user to select menu items, add to an online cart and initialize an order.

## Installation
* Clone / download bangkok-hill-in-react.
* Open the bangkok-hill-in-react folder in code editor or terminal.
* Install dependencies with:
```
$ npm install
```
* Once complete, start the server with:
```
$ npm start
```
* Note:  A web browser should automatically open the Bangkok Hill website.  If not, you can open a browser and manually navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
